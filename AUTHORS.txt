Main of the reason I want this open sourced is because if the site makes a design change, the script for it should be modified.

If you spot a design change (or something else) that makes the script unable to work for the given site - please fire an issue asap.

If you are programmer PRs with fixes are warmly welcomed and acknowledged with a virtual beer ??
